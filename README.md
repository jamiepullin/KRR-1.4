# KRR Independent Study Project
**Knowledge engine with simple reasoning capabilities**

## Description
Implements concepts from:

**Ronald Brachman and Hector Levesque. 2004. _Knowledge Representation and Reasoning_.  
Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA.**

The program implements logical term structures with specific attention to **Atoms**, **Compounds**, and **Rules**.  
Forward and backward chaining are demonstrated, supported by full **unification** capabilities.  
The project also illustrates elementary **rule-based logical reasoning**.
